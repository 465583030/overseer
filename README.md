:warning: This project is currently documentation only. There are [other](https://github.com/sanbornm/go-selfupdate) [projects](https://github.com/inconshreveable/go-update) for upgrading Go programs though they seem to place too many restrictions on how and when upgrades are performed.

# go-upgrade

Upgrade the binaries of running Go (Golang) programs

### Install

```
go get ...
```

### Usage

``` go
package main

var VERSION = "0.5.0" //set with ldflags

//to make your cli tool auto-upgradable:
//  change your 'main' into a 'prog'
func prog() {
	log.Printf("Running version %s...", VERSION)
	select {}
}

//the upgrade pkg will use the main process for the upgrading the
//binary, then fork and run 'prog' in a child process. when the binary
//changes, upgrade will ask 'prog' to close and when it does, it will
//spawn a new version
func main() {
	upgrade.Run(prog, upgrade.Config{
		Version: VERSION,
		URL: "https://example.com/build/prog.{{ .Version }}.tar",
	})
}
```

When performing an upgrade, the `Version` will be parsed and each of the numerical sections will be parsed. One at a time, from right to left, each will be incremented and the new URL will requested. So, in the example above, `0.5.1` will be tried, then `0.6.0`, then `1.5.0`. Numerical semantic versions aren't required, you could also simply have `v1`, which then would be incremented to `v2`.

**Note** this project is not a replacement for your init systems.

### Known issues

* Your new binary panics before the upgrade process and you're stuck with a broken version. This could possibly be resolved with `recover`.
* If for some reason the OS does not support a feature. `prog` will still run though upgrades will not occur.

### Todo

* Delta updates with https://github.com/kr/binarydist
