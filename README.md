# go-upgrade

Self-upgrading binaries in Go (Golang)

:warning: This is beta software

### Install

```
go get github.com/jpillora/go-upgrade
```

### Quick Usage

``` go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/jpillora/go-upgrade"
)

var VERSION = "0.0.0" //set with ldflags

//change your 'main' into a 'prog'
func prog() {
	log.Printf("Running version %s...", VERSION)
	select {}
}

//then create another 'main' which runs the upgrades
func main() {
	upgrade.Run(upgrade.Config{
		Program: prog,
		Version: VERSION,
		Fetcher: upgrade.BasicFetcher(
			"http://localhost:3000/myapp_{{.Version}}",
		),
		FetchInterval: 2 * time.Hour,
		Signal:        os.Interrupt,
	})
}
```

### How it works

* `go-upgrade` uses the main process to check for and install upgrades and a child process to run `Program`
* If the current binary cannot be found or written to, `go-upgrade` will be disabled and `Program` will run in the main process
* On load `Program` will be run in a child process
* All standard pipes are connected to the child process
* All signals received are forwarded through to the child process
* Every `CheckInterval` the fetcher's `Fetch` method is called with the current version
* The `BasicFetcher` requires a URL with a version placeholder. On `Fetch`, the current version will be incremented and result URL will be requested (raw bytes, `.tar.gz`, `.gz`, `.zip` binary releases are supported), if successful, the binary is returned.
* When the binary is returned, its version is tested and checked against the current version, if it differs the upgrade is considered successful and the desired `Signal` will be sent to the child process.
* When the child process exits, the main process will exit with the same code (except for upgrade restarts).
* Upgrade restarts are performed once after an upgrade - any subsequence exits will also cause the main process to exit - **so `go-upgrade` is not a process manager**.


### Fetchers

#### Basic

**Performs a simple web request at the desired URL**

When performing the version increment step, the current version will be parsed and each of the numerical sections will be grouped. One at a time, from right to left, each will be incremented and the new URL will requested. So, in the example above, `0.5.1` will be tried, then `0.6.0`, then `1.5.0`. Numerical semantic versions aren't required, you could also simply have `v1`, which then would be incremented to `v2`.

#### Github

**Uses Github releases to locate and download the newest version**

### Todo

* Delta updates with https://github.com/kr/binarydist
* Signed binaries (in the meantime, use HTTPS where possible)
