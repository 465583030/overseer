:warning: This project is currently documentation only. There are [other](https://github.com/sanbornm/go-selfupdate) [projects](https://github.com/inconshreveable/go-update) for upgrading Go programs though they seem to place too many restrictions on how and when upgrades are performed.

# go-upgrade

Upgrade the binaries of running Go (Golang) programs

### Install

```
go get ...
```

### Usage

``` go
package main

var VERSION = "0.5.0" //set with ldflags

func main() {
	u := upgrade.New(upgrade.Config{
		Version: VERSION,
		URL: "https://example.com/build/prog.{{ .Version }}.tar"
	})

	if upgraded, err := u.Upgrade(); err != nil {
		log.Print(err) //update process failed
	} else if !upgraded {
		//no updates found
	} else {
		//updated succeeded, your binary has been swapped, you can now:
		//1. continue execution, and the new version will be used on next run
		//2. os.Exit(0) and force user to restart
		//3. os.Exit(1) and allow the init system perform a restart
	}

	log.Printf("Running version %s...", VERSION)
	select {}
}
```

When doing an `Upgrade()`, the `Version` will be parsed and each of the numerical sections will be parsed. One at a time, from right to left, each will be incremented and the new URL will requested. So, in the example above, `0.5.1` will be tried, then `0.6.0`, then `1.5.0`. Numerical semantic versions aren't required, you could also simply have `v1`, which then would be incremented to `v2`.

### Known issues

* Your new binary panics before the upgrade process and you're stuck with a broken version. This could possibly be resolved with `recover`.

### Todo

* Delta updates with https://github.com/kr/binarydist
